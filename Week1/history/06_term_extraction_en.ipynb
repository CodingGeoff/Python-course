    "Multimodal generative large language models (MLLMs), a paradigmatic advancement in deep learning, integrate heterogeneous data modalities—encompassing textual embeddings, pixel-level visual features, acoustic waveforms, and even sensor-derived telemetry—to synthesize coherent, contextually aligned content that transcends the limitations of unimodal architectures. At their core, these models leverage a hybrid Transformer backbone augmented with cross-attention mechanisms and modality-specific encoders, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) for visual inputs and Wav2Vec 2.0 for auditory signals, enabling bidirectional feature propagation across distinct data domains.The pre-training phase of MLLMs is characterized by self-supervised learning paradigms, including contrastive alignment learning and masked modality modeling, which compel the model to infer missing or corrupted data segments while preserving inter-modal semantic consistency. For instance, during contrastive pre-training, the model maps textual prompts to corresponding visual embeddings in a shared latent space, minimizing the Euclidean distance between semantically congruent pairs and maximizing divergence between irrelevant ones— a process underpinned by triplet loss functions and hard negative mining strategies. This latent space calibration is critical for mitigating modality bias, a pervasive issue wherein the model over-reliance on high-fidelity modalities (e.g., visual data) at the expense of low-signal ones (e.g., sparse sensor readings).Post-pre-training, MLLMs undergo instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align with human intent, though this stage introduces non-trivial challenges, including catastrophic forgetting and distributional shift. Catastrophic forgetting manifests when fine-tuning on task-specific multimodal data erodes the model’s generalized knowledge of cross-modal relationships, necessitating techniques like elastic weight consolidation (EWC) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to freeze pre-trained weights while updating task-specific adapter layers. Distributional shift, conversely, arises from discrepancies between pre-training data distributions and real-world deployment scenarios—exacerbated by edge cases like occluded visual inputs, noisy audio streams, or domain-specific jargon—that degrade generative accuracy and coherence.Advanced MLLMs further incorporate diffusion models for high-fidelity content generation and causal inference frameworks to disentangle spurious correlations between modalities, enhancing robustness to adversarial perturbations and out-of-distribution inputs. For example, diffusion-based visual generation modules iteratively denoise Gaussian noise to produce photorealistic images conditioned on textual prompts, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) adjusting the trade-off between adherence to prompts and creative diversity. Causal inference, facilitated by structural causal models (SCMs), enables the model to identify causal relationships rather than mere statistical associations, reducing the risk of generating semantically inconsistent content (e.g., misaligning textual descriptions of mechanical components with their visual representations).Despite these advancements, scalability and computational efficiency remain bottlenecks for MLLMs, as the integration of multiple modalities exponentially increases parameter count (often exceeding 100B parameters for state-of-the-art models) and inference latency. To address this, researchers are exploring sparse attention mechanisms, quantization techniques (e.g., 4-bit and 8-bit quantization via bitsandbytes), and hybrid cloud-edge deployment strategies, where lightweight encoder-decoder modules process low-latency tasks at the edge, while heavyweight pre-trained backbones handle complex generative tasks in the cloud. Additionally, ethical considerations, including bias amplification across modalities, intellectual property disputes over training data (e.g., copyrighted images and proprietary audio), and the potential for deepfakes, mandate the implementation of explainable AI (XAI) tools and adversarial detection frameworks to ensure responsible deployment.\n",

    "Epigenetic Reprogramming of Tumor-Associated Macrophages: A Double-Edged Sword in Immunotherapeutic Resistance and Synergistic Targeting Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), the predominant myeloid subset within the tumor microenvironment (TME), exhibit remarkable phenotypic plasticity, transitioning between pro-inflammatory (M1-like) and anti-inflammatory (M2-like) states in response to cues derived from neoplastic cells, stromal components, and immune infiltrates. Recent advances in epigenetics have unraveled that this phenotypic switch is orchestrated by intricate, heritable modifications to the chromatin landscape—including DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-mediated regulation—that are dysregulated in TAMs during tumor progression. This review summarizes the epigenetic mechanisms underlying TAM reprogramming, emphasizing how aberrant epigenetic modifications drive TAM polarization toward an immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype, thereby fostering tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) resistance, and immune escape. We further dissect the paradoxical role of epigenetic reprogramming as a double-edged sword: while it contributes to tumor progression, it also presents exploitable vulnerabilities for therapeutic intervention. Finally, we discuss emerging synergistic strategies that combine epigenetic modulators (EpiMods) with ICB, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, or targeted therapies, highlighting preclinical and early clinical evidence, challenges in pharmacodynamic (PD) monitoring, and future directions to optimize personalized treatment regimens for cancer patients. \n",

    "Keywords: Tumor-associated macrophages; Epigenetic reprogramming; Histone modifications; Non-coding RNAs; Immunotherapeutic resistance; Synergistic targeting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a heterocellular niche composed of neoplastic cells, stromal cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells), immune cells (macrophages, T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)), and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, all of which engage in complex crosstalk to modulate tumor initiation, progression, and response to therapy [1]. Among these cellular components, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) constitute 30–50% of the immune infiltrate in most solid tumors, including breast cancer, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), making them a pivotal regulator of TME homeostasis and tumor biology [2]. Unlike tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs), which are derived from embryonic progenitors, TAMs are predominantly recruited from circulating monocytes in response to tumor-derived chemokines (e.g., CCL2, CCL5, CXCL12) and cytokines (e.g., CSF-1, IL-4, IL-13) [3]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The phenotypic plasticity of TAMs is a defining feature, with M1-like (classically activated) and M2-like (alternatively activated) states representing the two extremes of a continuous spectrum. M1-like TAMs are induced by microbial products (e.g., LPS) and Th1 cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ) and exert anti-tumor functions by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO), and presenting antigens to activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) [4]. In contrast, M2-like TAMs are driven by Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13), CSF-1, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and exhibit pro-tumor properties, including promotion of angiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), facilitation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and suppression of anti-tumor immune responses by expressing immune checkpoints (e.g., PD-L1, CD206) and secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β) [5]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, TAM polarization is not a static process but is dynamically regulated by epigenetic mechanisms that alter gene expression patterns without changing the DNA sequence. Epigenetic reprogramming in TAMs is driven by tumor-derived signals and is critical for the acquisition and maintenance of the M2-like immunosuppressive phenotype, which has been implicated in resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies (e.g., anti-PD-1/PD-L1, anti-CTLA-4) that rely on activating the host anti-tumor immune response [6]. Despite the growing recognition of TAMs as a therapeutic target, the epigenetic circuits governing their reprogramming remain incompletely understood, and strategies to reverse M2-like polarization or deplete TAMs have shown limited clinical efficacy as monotherapies. Thus, dissecting the epigenetic landscape of TAMs and identifying synergistic targeting strategies are essential to overcome immunotherapeutic resistance and improve clinical outcomes for cancer patients. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Epigenetic Mechanisms Governing TAM Reprogramming\n",
    "\n",
    "Epigenetic regulation encompasses three interconnected layers: DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-mediated gene silencing or activation. These mechanisms work in concert to remodel the chromatin structure, thereby controlling the accessibility of transcription factors (TFs) to target gene promoters and enhancers, and ultimately shaping TAM phenotypic polarization. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 DNA Methylation\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark characterized by the covalent addition of a methyl group to the 5-position of cytosine residues (5mC) within CpG dinucleotides, predominantly in gene promoters and enhancer regions. This modification is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), including DNMT1 (maintenance methyltransferase) and DNMT3A/3B (de novo methyltransferases), and is reversed by ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes (TET1, TET2, TET3), which oxidize 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) prior to base excision repair (BER)-mediated demethylation [7]. \n",
    "\n",
    "In TAMs, aberrant DNA methylation patterns are associated with phenotypic polarization. For instance, M2-like TAMs isolated from human NSCLC tissues exhibit hypermethylation of promoters of pro-inflammatory genes (e.g., IL-1β, TNF-α, iNOS) compared to M1-like TAMs and circulating monocytes [8]. This hypermethylation is driven by increased DNMT3A expression in TAMs, which is induced by tumor-derived CSF-1. Inhibition of DNMT3A using small-molecule inhibitors (e.g., azacitidine, decitabine) restores the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, reverses M2-like polarization, and enhances the anti-tumor activity of CTLs in murine NSCLC models [8]. Conversely, hypomethylation of M2-associated genes (e.g., IL-10, CD206, Arg1) is observed in TAMs from breast cancer patients, and this hypomethylation is mediated by downregulation of TET2 expression [9]. TET2 deficiency in TAMs promotes M2 polarization and tumor metastasis, while restoration of TET2 activity via lentiviral overexpression inhibits M2-like functions and suppresses tumor growth in murine breast cancer models [9]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, DNA methylation patterns in TAMs are dynamically regulated by the TME. For example, hypoxic conditions in the TME (a hallmark of solid tumors) upregulate DNMT1 expression in TAMs via the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) pathway, leading to hypermethylation of PTEN (a tumor suppressor gene) and activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which further reinforces M2-like polarization [10]. These findings highlight the interplay between TME cues and DNA methylation in shaping TAM phenotype. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 Histone Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Histones (H2A, H2B, H3, H4) form the core of nucleosomes, and their N-terminal tails undergo a variety of PTMs, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation. These modifications alter the electrostatic interactions between histones and DNA, leading to chromatin relaxation (euchromatin, permissive for transcription) or condensation (heterochromatin, repressive for transcription), and also serve as docking sites for TFs and co-regulators [11]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Histone acetylation, catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) (e.g., p300/CBP, GCN5) and reversed by histone deacetylases (HDACs) (e.g., HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC6), is a key regulator of TAM polarization. M1-like TAMs exhibit increased acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9ac) and H3K27ac (marks associated with active transcription) at the promoters of pro-inflammatory genes, while M2-like TAMs show reduced H3K9ac/H3K27ac and increased deacetylation at these loci [12]. Inhibition of HDACs (e.g., pan-HDAC inhibitors vorinostat, romidepsin) increases H3K9ac/H3K27ac at pro-inflammatory gene promoters, reverses M2-like polarization, and enhances the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in murine melanoma models [12]. Specifically, HDAC6 has been identified as a critical regulator of TAM function: HDAC6 deficiency in TAMs promotes M1 polarization by increasing the acetylation and activation of STAT1 (a key Th1 transcription factor), while HDAC6 overexpression in TAMs from human melanoma tissues correlates with ICB resistance [13]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Histone methylation, mediated by histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and histone demethylases (HDMs), is another important PTM regulating TAM reprogramming. For example, the HMT G9a (also known as EHMT2) catalyzes the methylation of H3K9 (H3K9me2), a repressive mark, at the promoters of M1-associated genes (e.g., iNOS, IL-1β) in TAMs [14]. G9a expression is upregulated in M2-like TAMs from human GBM tissues, and genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of G9a (using BIX-01294) reduces H3K9me2 levels, restores M1 gene expression, and inhibits tumor growth in murine GBM models [14]. Conversely, the H3K4 methyltransferase MLL1 (mixed-lineage leukemia 1) promotes M1 polarization by activating the transcription of IFN-γ-responsive genes, and MLL1 deficiency in TAMs leads to enhanced M2 polarization and tumor progression [15]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other histone PTMs, such as histone ubiquitination and phosphorylation, also contribute to TAM reprogramming, though their roles are less well-characterized. For instance, the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 mediates the ubiquitination of histone H2B at lysine 120 (H2BK120ub) in TAMs, which is required for M1-like polarization and anti-tumor immunity [16]. TRAF6 deficiency in TAMs reduces H2BK120ub levels, impairs M1 gene expression, and promotes tumor metastasis in murine colon cancer models [16]. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.3 Non-Coding RNAs (ncRNAs)\n",
    "\n",
    "ncRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), are emerging as key epigenetic regulators of TAM reprogramming. Unlike coding RNAs, ncRNAs do not encode proteins but instead regulate gene expression at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, or translational level [17]. \n",
    "\n",
    "miRNAs are small (18–22 nt) ncRNAs that bind to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression. Several miRNAs have been implicated in TAM polarization. For example, miR-155 is highly expressed in M1-like TAMs and promotes M1 polarization by targeting suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), a negative regulator of the JAK/STAT pathway [18]. miR-155 deficiency in TAMs leads to increased SOCS1 expression, impaired M1 polarization, and enhanced tumor growth in murine lung cancer models [18]. Conversely, miR-223 is upregulated in M2-like TAMs and promotes M2 polarization by targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), a TF that regulates lipid metabolism and M2 function [19]. Inhibition of miR-223 using antagomiRs reduces M2-like TAM infiltration and enhances anti-PD-L1 therapy efficacy in murine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) models [19]. \n",
    "\n",
    "lncRNAs (>200 nt) regulate gene expression by interacting with DNA, RNA, or proteins to modulate chromatin structure, TF activity, or mRNA stability. For instance, lncRNA M2 macrophage-associated long non-coding RNA (M2LNC) is highly expressed in M2-like TAMs from human breast cancer tissues and promotes M2 polarization by sponging miR-125a, thereby upregulating the expression of its target gene IL-13Rα1 (a receptor for IL-13, a key M2-inducing cytokine) [20]. Silencing of M2LNC reduces M2-like TAM infiltration and inhibits tumor angiogenesis in murine breast cancer models [20]. Another lncRNA, TAM-derived lncRNA (TANCR), is induced by CSF-1 in TAMs and promotes M2 polarization by interacting with the HAT p300, leading to increased acetylation of H3K27 at M2-associated gene promoters [21]. \n",
    "\n",
    "circRNAs, which are covalently closed circular RNAs derived from back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, also regulate TAM reprogramming by acting as miRNA sponges or interacting with proteins. For example, circRNA CDR1as is upregulated in M2-like TAMs from human NSCLC tissues and promotes M2 polarization by sponging miR-7, thereby upregulating the expression ofEGFR and activating the PI3K/Akt pathway [22]. Inhibition of CDR1as reduces M2-like TAM function and enhances anti-tumor immunity in murine NSCLC models [22]. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Epigenetic Reprogramming of TAMs and Immunotherapeutic Resistance\n",
    "\n",
    "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies have revolutionized the treatment of various cancers, including melanoma, NSCLC, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), by disrupting inhibitory signaling pathways (e.g., PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA-4) and activating CTLs [23]. However, only 20–40% of patients respond to ICB therapy, and resistance—either primary (innate) or acquired (adaptive)—remains a major clinical challenge [24]. Accumulating evidence indicates that epigenetic reprogramming of TAMs plays a critical role in ICB resistance by fostering an immunosuppressive TME. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.1 Primary Resistance\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary resistance to ICB is characterized by the inability of the immune system to mount an effective anti-tumor response, even in the absence of prior ICB exposure. Epigenetically reprogrammed M2-like TAMs contribute to primary resistance by multiple mechanisms: (1) suppressing CTL activation and function via secretion of IL-10, TGF-β, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and expression of PD-L1; (2) recruiting immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and MDSCs, via chemokines (e.g., CCL22, CXCL10); (3) promoting angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation, which reduces T cell infiltration into the TME; and (4) inducing EMT in tumor cells, which enhances their invasiveness and immune evasion [25]. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in murine melanoma models, TAMs with aberrant HDAC6 expression exhibit M2-like polarization and express high levels of PD-L1, which directly inhibits CTL function and confers primary resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy [13]. Inhibition of HDAC6 reverses M2-like polarization, reduces PD-L1 expression on TAMs, and restores CTL activity, thereby overcoming primary resistance [13]. Similarly, in human NSCLC patients with primary resistance to anti-PD-L1 therapy, TAMs exhibit hypermethylation of pro-inflammatory gene promoters and increased expression of DNMT3A, which correlates with reduced CTL infiltration and poor clinical outcomes [8]. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 Acquired Resistance\n",
    "\n",
    "Acquired resistance develops in patients who initially respond to ICB therapy but later experience disease progression. Epigenetic reprogramming of TAMs is a key driver of acquired resistance, as continuous exposure to ICB and tumor-derived signals induces dynamic changes in TAM phenotype. For instance, in murine models of acquired anti-PD-1 resistance, TAMs undergo further M2-like polarization via upregulation of G9a expression, which increases H3K9me2 levels at M1-associated gene promoters and suppresses pro-inflammatory gene expression [14]. Inhibition of G9a restores M1 polarization and re-sensitizes tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy [14]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another mechanism of acquired resistance involves the induction of ncRNA expression in TAMs. For example, in human melanoma patients with acquired anti-PD-1 resistance, TAMs exhibit increased expression of miR-223, which promotes M2 polarization and reduces CTL activity by targeting PPARγ [19]. Inhibition of miR-223 re-sensitizes tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy in murine models [19]. Additionally, acquired resistance can be driven by TME-induced epigenetic changes in TAMs, such as hypoxia-mediated upregulation of DNMT1, which enhances M2-like polarization and suppresses anti-tumor immunity [10]. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Synergistic Targeting Strategies: Epigenetic Modulators and Immunotherapies\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the critical role of TAM epigenetic reprogramming in immunotherapeutic resistance, combining epigenetic modulators (EpiMods) with immunotherapies has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance anti-tumor efficacy. EpiMods can reverse M2-like TAM polarization, restore pro-inflammatory gene expression, and remodel the TME to improve the activity of immunotherapies, such as ICB, CAR-T cell therapy, and targeted therapies. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.1 EpiMods + Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB)\n",
    "\n",
    "Preclinical studies have demonstrated robust synergism between EpiMods and ICB therapy. For example, in murine NSCLC models, combination therapy with DNMT inhibitors (azacitidine) and anti-PD-L1 therapy reverses M2-like TAM polarization, increases CTL infiltration, and inhibits tumor growth more effectively than either monotherapy [8]. Similarly, in murine melanoma models, HDAC6 inhibitors (tubastatin A) combined with anti-PD-1 therapy reduce PD-L1 expression on TAMs, enhance CTL activity, and improve survival [13]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Early clinical trials are also exploring this combination. For instance, a phase I/II trial (NCT03993861) is evaluating the combination of azacitidine (DNMT inhibitor) and durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) in patients with advanced solid tumors, with preliminary data showing promising anti-tumor activity and manageable toxicity [26]. Another phase I trial (NCT04055220) is investigating the combination of vorinostat (HDAC inhibitor) and pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in patients with advanced melanoma, with early results indicating improved response rates compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy [27]. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.2 EpiMods + CAR-T Cell Therapy\n",
    "\n",
    "CAR-T cell therapy has shown remarkable efficacy in hematologic malignancies but has limited activity in solid tumors, largely due to the immunosuppressive TME, including M2-like TAMs [28]. EpiMods can remodel the TME to enhance CAR-T cell trafficking, infiltration, and function. For example, in murine glioblastoma models, treatment with G9a inhibitor (BIX-01294) reverses M2-like TAM polarization, reduces the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), and enhances the infiltration and anti-tumor activity of EGFRvIII-targeted CAR-T cells [14]. Similarly, in murine breast cancer models, HDAC inhibitor (romidepsin) treatment increases the expression of chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10) in TAMs, which recruits CAR-T cells to the TME and improves anti-tumor efficacy [29]. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.3 EpiMods + Targeted Therapies\n",
    "\n",
    "Targeted therapies (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), anti-angiogenic agents) can also synergize with EpiMods by modulating the TME and enhancing TAM reprogramming. For example, in murine HCC models, combination therapy with sorafenib (a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR, RAF, and PDGFR) and miR-155 mimics reduces M2-like TAM infiltration, inhibits angiogenesis, and suppresses tumor growth more effectively than sorafenib monotherapy [18]. Similarly, in murine NSCLC models, combination therapy with bevacizumab (anti-VEGF antibody) and TET2 overexpression in TAMs reverses M2-like polarization, enhances anti-tumor immunity, and improves survival [9]. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Challenges and Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the promising preclinical and early clinical data, several challenges must be addressed to optimize synergistic epigenetic-immunotherapeutic strategies. First, the lack of robust pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers to monitor TAM epigenetic reprogramming and response to therapy remains a major barrier. Current biomarkers, such as changes in cytokine levels or T cell infiltration, are non-specific, and novel biomarkers—including TAM-specific epigenetic marks (e.g., H3K9me2, 5hmC) and ncRNAs (e.g., miR-155, M2LNC)—need to be validated in clinical trials [30]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, EpiMods often exhibit off-target effects and systemic toxicity, which limits their clinical utility. For example, pan-HDAC inhibitors can cause hematologic toxicity, gastrointestinal side effects, and fatigue, while DNMT inhibitors can induce myelosuppression [31]. The development of TAM-specific EpiMods, such as targeted delivery systems (e.g., liposomes, nanoparticles) that selectively accumulate in TAMs, could reduce off-target effects and improve safety [32]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the heterogeneity of TAMs and the dynamic nature of epigenetic reprogramming pose challenges for personalized therapy. TAMs exhibit significant inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity, and their epigenetic profiles can change in response to therapy and TME cues [33]. Single-cell sequencing technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq), can be used to dissect TAM heterogeneity and identify patient-specific epigenetic vulnerabilities, enabling the development of personalized combination regimens [34]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the molecular mechanisms underlying the synergism between EpiMods and immunotherapies are not fully understood. Further research is needed to elucidate how EpiMods remodel the TME, regulate TAM-T cell crosstalk, and overcome immunotherapeutic resistance, which could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets and combination strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Epigenetic reprogramming of TAMs is a key driver of tumor progression and immunotherapeutic resistance, characterized by dynamic changes in DNA methylation, histone PTMs, and ncRNA expression that promote M2-like polarization. However, this epigenetic reprogramming also presents exploitable vulnerabilities, and combining EpiMods with immunotherapies (ICB, CAR-T cell therapy) or targeted therapies has shown promising synergistic effects in preclinical and early clinical studies. Despite the challenges, advances in single-cell sequencing, targeted delivery systems, and PD biomarker development are paving the way for personalized epigenetic-immunotherapeutic strategies that can overcome resistance and improve clinical outcomes for cancer patients. Future research should focus on dissecting the molecular mechanisms of TAM epigenetic reprogramming, validating novel biomarkers, and optimizing combination regimens to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity. \n",
